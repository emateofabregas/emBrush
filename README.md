I turned a gizmo a previous toolset that I created for a personal project. My main idea was to get the brush while keeping some parts of the original render. You can get it using a Keyer as a mask and playing with max merge operation, mainly. This gizmo is using another gizmo from Michael Levin (https://github.com/michaellevin/kuwahara-filter-nuke).
